# mini-maxi-inject
**mini-maxi-sof.exe**
It's a stand-alone version so all you need is the .exe (the sofplus func file will be copied if one isnt found)
__usage__ 
Place the exe in user folder. Can start before or after "SoF.exe" (must be exact name) You will hear one sound on begin, and a few moments later, another sound when its finished. You can then minimise / maximise SoF freely with the desktop resolution returning to normal.

__extra features__
No more annoying sound spam when you return to SoF after minimising.
s_nosound 1 <- is set when you minimise
s_nosound 0 <- is set when you maximise
