# mini-maxi-inject
**mini-maxi-sof.exe**
It's a stand-alone version so all you need is the .exe (the sofplus func file will be copied if one isnt found) and the .ini file is optional (if you want to rename the SoF.exe or disable the 2 sound alerts on begin / end.

SoF.exe does not return the desktop resolution back to its original value when minimised, this mod fixes that issue.

__usage__    
Place the exe in user folder. Can start before or after "SoF.exe" (or any value in the .ini file) You will hear one sound on begin, and a few moments later, another sound when its finished. You can then minimise / maximise SoF freely with the desktop resolution returning to normal.

__extra features__  
No more annoying sound spam when you return to SoF after minimising.  
s_nosound 1 <- is set when you minimise  
s_nosound 0 <- is set when you maximise   


__using the source files__
